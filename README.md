# housing_sales_prediction
In this project, I have predicted Housing sales price prices for King County,USA which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.   It has 19 house features plus the price and the id columns, along with 21613 observations.  In this project I have done the implementation of different Boosting regression machine learning models such as Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Adaboost.  In this project, I have also used Permutation Importance for filtering the irrelevant features of the dataset.
